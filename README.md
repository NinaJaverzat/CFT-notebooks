# CFT-notebooks
Mathematica notebooks for computing model independent and model dependent CFT data.

* CFT-general.nb: Liouville structure constants, Virasoro related quantities (beta coefficients, conformal blocks).
* Potts-torus-partition: computes the partition function of the Q-state Potts model.
* Two-point-torus: computes the topological corrections of the two-point connectivity in the Q-state Potts model derived in Nina Javerzat et al J. Stat. Mech. (2020) 023101 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/ab6331
